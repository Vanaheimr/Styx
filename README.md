Pipes.NET is a graph-based data flow framework for [property graph models](http://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-Property-Graph)
written in .NET/Mono. It comes with some syntactic sugar to build a powerful "LINQ to graphs" interface. A process graph is composed of a set of process vertices connected to one another by a set of communication edges. Pipes supports the splitting, merging, and transformation of data from input to output. 

#### Usage

Pipes.NET comes with some syntactic sugar to make coexistence with LINQ a bit easier.

    var _Friends = _Graph.VertexId(1).
                   OutEdges("knows").
                   InVertex().
                   GetProperty<String>("name");

    _Friends.ForEach(_Friend => Console.WriteLine(_Friend));

...which is in detail equivalent to the following standard syntax:

    var _Pipe1    = new VertexEdgePipe(VertexEdgePipe.Step.OUT_EDGES);
    var _Pipe2    = new LabelFilterPipe("knows", ComparisonFilter.NOT_EQUAL);
    var _Pipe3    = new EdgeVertexPipe(EdgeVertexPipe.Step.IN_VERTEX);
    var _Pipe4    = new VertexPropertyPipe<String>("name");
    var _Pipeline = new Pipeline<IVertex,String>(_Pipe1, _Pipe2, _Pipe3, _Pipe4);
    _Pipeline.SetSource(new SingleEnumerator<IVertex>(_Graph.GetVertex(new VertexId(1)));
    foreach (var _Friend in _Pipeline)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(_Friend);
    }

#### Help and Documentation

Additional help and much more examples can be found in the [Wiki](http://github.com/ahzf/pipes.NET/wiki).   
News and updates can also be found on twitter by following: [@ahzf](http://www.twitter.com/ahzf) or [@graphdbs](http://www.twitter.com/graphdbs).

#### Installation

The installation of Pipes.NET is very straightforward. Just check out or download its sources and all its dependencies:

- [Blueprints.NET](https://github.com/ahzf/blueprints.NET) for the handling of property graphs
- [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/) for unit tests

If you are interessted in using the [PipesShell](https://github.com/ahzf/pipes.NET/wiki/PipesShell-for-Adhoc-Graph-Querying) you have to add the latest Mono.CSharp.dll or project.
