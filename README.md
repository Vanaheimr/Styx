Pipes.NET is a graph-based data flow framework for [property graph models](http://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-Property-Graph)
written in .NET/Mono. A process graph is composed of a set of process vertices connected to one another by a set of communication edges.
Pipes supports the splitting, merging, and transformation of data from input to output.
